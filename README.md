# Group Project 10

## Presentation

This project will be a supervised machine learning of Classification type. 
### Content

#### Selected topic 
Taking the most prescribed drug leading to hospitatlization and death


#### Reason why they selected their topic 
We wanted to work with a real-world dataset, and from this data set from FDA, we could ask and answer a question about an impportant question that could be anyone's question and concern, no matter where in the world they live and what in the world they do!

#### Description of their source of data 
This is a dataset about medications and their effect (adverse effect) on those who take them

#### Questions they hope to answer with the data
The question to answer is the likelihood of getting hospitalized or dying by taking this medication. Using a supervised machine learning classificaion method, we want to be able to predict, -by looking at the age, gender, family history,...- whether the patient will have serious reactions to Atorvastatin, that will have them hospitalized or not and whether they will have very serious reactions that may cause death or not.
